# Requirements Archive: Event Deduplication Service v0.1

**Defined:** 2026-02-27
**Archived:** 2026-02-28
**Core Value:** Accurate event deduplication -- the same real-world event appearing across multiple source PDFs must be reliably grouped, with the best information from all sources combined into a single canonical event.

## v1 Requirements -- All Complete

### Ground Truth & Evaluation

- [x] **EVAL-01**: System includes a labeled ground truth dataset of 200-300 event pairs (same/different) from the 765-event sample data -- *Delivered: 1181 labeled pairs (248 same, 933 different) via auto-generation*
- [x] **EVAL-02**: Evaluation harness reports precision, recall, and F1 score for deduplication decisions
- [x] **EVAL-03**: Evaluation can be run against any threshold configuration to measure impact of changes

### Matching Core

- [x] **MTCH-01**: System scores event similarity using multiple signals: date, geo proximity, title, and description
- [x] **MTCH-02**: System uses blocking by date + city/geo grid to reduce candidate comparisons (>95% reduction)
- [x] **MTCH-03**: Date matching handles same-day events with time tolerance (~30 min) and multi-day event date range overlap
- [x] **MTCH-04**: Geo-proximity matching uses haversine distance weighted by each event's geo confidence score
- [x] **MTCH-05**: Fuzzy title matching handles German compound words, umlauts, and OCR artifacts
- [x] **MTCH-06**: Similarity thresholds are configurable without code changes (high-confidence auto-match, ambiguous zone, auto-reject)
- [x] **MTCH-07**: German dialect synonym dictionary maps equivalent terms (Fasnet/Fasching/Fastnacht/Karneval etc.)
- [x] **MTCH-08**: Category-aware matching weights adjust calibration per event type (carnival events weighted differently than political events)
- [x] **MTCH-09**: Source-type-aware comparison adjusts for artikel (journalistic headline) vs terminliste (event name) title formats
- [x] **MTCH-10**: Deduplication uses graph-based clustering (connected components), not pairwise decisions

### AI-Assisted Matching

- [x] **AI-01**: Ambiguous event pairs (scoring between low and high threshold) are sent to an LLM for resolution
- [x] **AI-02**: AI matching uses Gemini Flash (or best cost-effective model determined during implementation research)
- [x] **AI-03**: AI responses include structured decision, confidence score, and reasoning
- [x] **AI-04**: AI match results are cached to avoid re-evaluating identical pairs
- [x] **AI-05**: AI usage is cost-monitored with per-batch and per-period reporting

### Canonical Event Management

- [x] **CANL-01**: Canonical event is synthesized by selecting the best field value from each source (longest description, most precise location, richest highlights, etc.)
- [x] **CANL-02**: Field-level provenance tracks which source event contributed each canonical field
- [x] **CANL-03**: When new source events match an existing canonical, the canonical is enriched with any better information without downgrading existing good data
- [x] **CANL-04**: Each match/group decision has a confidence score (0-1) derived from individual signal scores

### Data Pipeline

- [x] **PIPE-01**: Docker container watches a configured directory for new JSON files
- [x] **PIPE-02**: Processing is idempotent -- re-processing the same file does not create duplicate records
- [x] **PIPE-03**: Each file is processed in a single database transaction (all-or-nothing)
- [x] **PIPE-04**: Service connects directly to PostgreSQL to read existing events and write canonical events + source links
- [x] **PIPE-05**: Structured processing logs report events processed, matches found, new canonicals created, and errors per file

### Frontend: Browse & Search

- [x] **UI-01**: Searchable paginated list of canonical events with filters for title, city, date range, and category
- [x] **UI-02**: Canonical event detail view shows all fields (title, description, highlights, dates, location, categories, flags)
- [x] **UI-03**: Drill-down from canonical event to all contributing source events with side-by-side comparison
- [x] **UI-04**: Match confidence indicators show per-source signal scores (title similarity %, geo distance, date match)

### Frontend: Manual Review

- [x] **REV-01**: Manual split -- detach a source event from a canonical event (create new canonical or assign to another)
- [x] **REV-02**: Manual merge -- combine two canonical events into one, re-synthesize canonical fields
- [x] **REV-03**: Review queue of low-confidence matches sorted by uncertainty (most ambiguous first)
- [x] **REV-04**: All manual override decisions are logged with an audit trail
- [x] **REV-05**: Batch processing dashboard showing match rates, error rates, and processing trends over time

### Deployment

- [x] **DEPL-01**: All services run as Docker containers (pipeline worker, API server, frontend)
- [x] **DEPL-02**: docker-compose.yml defines the full stack including PostgreSQL for development
- [x] **DEPL-03**: Environment-based configuration (database connection, watched directory, AI API keys, thresholds)

## v2 Requirements (Deferred)

- **ACC-01**: Feedback loop -- manual review decisions automatically inform threshold tuning recommendations
- **ACC-02**: Duplicate cluster visualization (network graph showing source overlap patterns)
- **ACC-03**: Incremental blocking key indexing for datasets >10K events/week

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time streaming ingestion | Source files arrive in weekly batches; batch processing is sufficient |
| User authentication | Internal tool, no auth needed; add reverse-proxy auth later if needed |
| Mobile-responsive frontend | Desktop-first internal tool; responsive doubles frontend effort |
| ML model training pipeline | Insufficient labeled data; LLM outperforms at this scale |
| Elasticsearch/Solr | PostgreSQL pg_trgm handles this volume trivially |
| PDF extraction modifications | Upstream pipeline is separate; we accept JSON as-is |
| Event recommendations | This is a dedup system, not a consumer-facing event platform |

### Documentation Discrepancies (non-blocking)

4 requirements have stale checkboxes in REQUIREMENTS.md -- code is complete but checkboxes were never updated:

| Requirement | Issue | Evidence |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| EVAL-01 | Checkbox [ ] but ground_truth.db has 1181 pairs (exceeds 200-300 target) | scripts/generate_ground_truth.py, Plan 01-04 complete |
| MTCH-07 | Checkbox [ ] but synonyms.yaml + synonyms.py + normalizer integration done | Plan 07-01 complete |
| MTCH-08 | Checkbox [ ] but CategoryWeightsConfig + resolve_weights() + matching.yaml done | Plan 07-02 complete |
| MTCH-09 | Checkbox [ ] but cross_source_type TitleConfig + title_scorer integration done | Plan 07-01 complete |

**Root cause:** REQUIREMENTS.md last updated after Phase 6 -- Phase 7 checkboxes were never toggled.

## Cross-Phase Integration

**8/8 integration points verified -- all PASS.**

| Integration Point | Status | Evidence |
|-------------------|--------|---------|
| Phase 1 -> Phase 2 (source events + ground truth feed matching) | PASS | file_processor.py -> persistence.py -> pipeline.py |
| Phase 2 -> Phase 3 (matching pipeline in worker) | PASS | orchestrator.py imports run_full_pipeline |
| Phase 3 -> Phase 4 (API reads canonical events) | PASS | canonical_events.py queries CanonicalEvent table |
| Phase 2 -> Phase 5 (ambiguous pairs feed AI) | PASS | resolver.py filters d.decision == "ambiguous" |
| Phase 5 -> Phase 3 (AI resolution in worker) | PASS | orchestrator.py calls _maybe_resolve_ai() |
| Phase 4 -> Phase 6 (browse UI extended with review) | PASS | 10/10 API routes have frontend consumers |
| Phase 6 -> Phase 2 (review uses synthesize_canonical) | PASS | operations.py imports from canonical.synthesizer |
| Phase 7 -> Phase 1+2 (synonyms + category weights + source-type) | PASS | normalizer.py, pipeline.py, title_scorer.py |

**Orphaned exports:** 0
**Missing connections:** 0
**Broken flows:** 0

## End-to-End Flow Validation

**6/6 critical flows verified end-to-end.**

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| JSON File -> Canonical Events -> API Display | 11 steps | COMPLETE |
| Ambiguous Match -> AI Resolution -> Updated Canonical | 7 steps | COMPLETE |
| Review Queue -> Split Source -> Audit Log | 8 steps | COMPLETE |
| Review Queue -> Merge Events -> Audit Log | 7 steps | COMPLETE |
| Dashboard Stats & Processing History | 4 steps | COMPLETE |
| Evaluation Harness (Ground Truth -> Pipeline -> Metrics) | 5 steps | COMPLETE |

## UAT Reports

| Phase | Status | Key Results |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Phase 3 | PASS | Docker stack runs, file watcher works, API responds |
| Phase 6 | PASS | Split/merge operations work, audit trail recorded |
| Phase 7 | PASS | Synonyms normalize correctly, category weights resolve, cross-type scoring improves |

## Tech Debt & Gaps

- **Documentation only:** 4 stale REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes (will be fixed during milestone archive)
- **No TODO/FIXME/HACK** comments found indicating incomplete work
- **No broken tests** or known regressions
- **No security concerns** identified (auth explicitly out of scope per requirements)

## Verdict

**PASSED** -- All 39 requirements implemented, all cross-phase integrations wired, all E2E flows complete, 371 tests green. Ready for milestone completion.
